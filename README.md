# Q

Q is a command line tool for programmers to make their lives better in any way
they see fit.  At its base is a todo list and note taking application, but its
support for plugins makes it infinitely extendible in any way imaginable.

## Why is it called Q?

<img align=right width=100 src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3185864/4443856/dd44f740-47eb-11e4-8429-0f2b9fb79d1c.png">Q is a character on Star the Next Generation with apparent omnipotence.  This fits well with the design goals of the Q application, because it is intended to be extensible to do anything.  He also
happens to have a single-letter name, which makes the command very easy to type.  

## Plugins

Q is extensible via plugins that exist as executables in your path.
